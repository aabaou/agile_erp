## How to install the act_ckeditor module manually <a id="manually"></a>
If you do not use the ckeditor.sh script, you will need to create a libraries folder at the root of the site.

You need to find out which CKEditor version your Drupal is using in order to download the appropriate version of the plugin. Find the core/assets/vendor/ckeditor/ckeditor.js file inside Drupal code and search for "version." You will find it beside the "timestamp".

On the [plugins page](http://ckeditor.com/addons/plugins/all), check for the right version to download for your CKEditor. Unzip the file and place the resulting folder inside the libraries folder on your Drupal root directory.

Because of the configuration files included in the act_ckeditor module, it is also necessary to activate a number of modules that appear in the dependencies. For a list of modules and libraries to be installed, see the [ckeditor.sh](../../../../scripts/drupal/README.md) documentation.
