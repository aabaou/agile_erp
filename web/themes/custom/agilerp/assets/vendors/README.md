### Install Vendors

All vendors are versioned, so nothing must be done when installing the project. They are located in web/assets/vendors folder.

**You must use bower and gulp when you install a new vendor :**

Go to web folder and run this commands :
```
bower install --save my_vendor
```
If you want to install a specific version :
```
bower install --save my_vendor#version
```
